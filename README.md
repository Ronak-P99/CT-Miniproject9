# CT-Miniproject9
This Project is an interactive webpage that finds you all the information you need about a certain Pokemon. Once entered the page, you will be greeted by a header section that
is visually appealing. Just under the header, you can find a search bar. In that search bar, type in the pokemon name you would like information about and click "Search".
Then just let the webpage do its magic! Enjoy!
